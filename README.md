# projectmanagement

This webpage displays the current date and a 9am-5pm schedule for planning out hourly tasks or events. Hour blocks are dynamically color-coded to show if the hour is in the past, present, or future. Text added in each hour block can be saved with the save button to local storage and rendered onto the browser after the user exits out of the webpage.
